    {
      "v": 2,
      "t": "The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them, and the new wine will fail her."

      "t": "They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria."
    },
    {
      "v": 4,
      "t": "They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into Yahweh’s house."

      "v": 7,
      "t": "The days of visitation have come. The days of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool, and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of your sins, and because your hostility is great."
    },
    {
      "v": 8,
      "t": "A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God. A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of his God."

      "v": 10,
      "t": "I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season; but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved."

    {
      "v": 11,
