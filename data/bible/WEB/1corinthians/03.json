    },

      "v": 3,
      "t": "for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?"
    },
    {
      "v": 4,
      "t": "For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?"

      "v": 9,
      "t": "For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building."
