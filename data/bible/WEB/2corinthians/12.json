      "v": 2,
      "t": "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven."

    },
    {
      "v": 5,
      "t": "On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses."
    },
    {
      "v": 6,
      "t": "For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me."

    {
      "v": 7,
      "t": "By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively."

      "v": 8,
      "t": "Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me."

      "v": 9,
      "t": "He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me."
    },
    {
      "v": 10,
      "t": "Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong."
    },
    {
      "v": 11,
      "t": "I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing."
    },
    {
      "v": 12,
      "t": "Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works."

    {
      "v": 14,
      "t": "Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
    },
    {
      "v": 15,
      "t": "I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?"

      "v": 19,
      "t": "Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying."
    },
    {
      "v": 20,
      "t": "For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire, that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, or riots,"
