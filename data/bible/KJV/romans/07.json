    },
    {
      "v": 2,
      "t": "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."
    },
    {
      "v": 3,
      "t": "So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
    },
    {
      "v": 4,
      "t": "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
    },
    {
      "v": 5,
      "t": "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."

      "v": 7,
      "t": "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."
    },
    {
      "v": 8,
      "t": "But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead."
