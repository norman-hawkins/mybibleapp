      "v": 3,
      "t": "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"

      "v": 21,
      "t": "Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."

      "t": "But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
    },
    {
      "v": 26,
      "t": "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
    },
