There's either a scribal mistake there and it should be \"hos an\" for \"whoever\". Or the \"literal\" scan should be \"he-who if he should not be offended\" I chose to match hos with \"he whosoever\" and let the ean be unmatched in this context. otoh, the strong's dictionary (which would have been strongly influenced by verses like this, seems to allow the ean to be whosoever. I guess I should let it stand that way. In failing to respect the discourse differences between Greek and English it's weaker but there it is… blech, but it's teamwork. And then, I came back and changed my mind after reading the guidelines and deciding I hadn't been following them.:)"
