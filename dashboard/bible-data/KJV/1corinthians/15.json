      "t": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
    },
    {
      "v": 54,
      "t": "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
