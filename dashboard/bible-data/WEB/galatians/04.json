      "v": 9,
      "t": "But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?"

      "v": 14,
      "t": "That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."

    {
      "v": 22,
      "t": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant, and one by the free woman."
    },
    {
      "v": 23,
      "t": "However, the son by the servant was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise."
    },
    {
      "v": 24,
      "t": "These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar."
    },

      "v": 25,
      "t": "For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children."

      "v": 26,
      "t": "But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
    },
    {
      "v": 27,
      "t": "For it is written, “Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear. Break out and shout, you who don’t travail. For the desolate have more children than her who has a husband.”"
    },
    {
      "v": 28,
      "t": "Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise."

      "v": 30,
      "t": "However what does the Scripture say? “Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not inherit with the son of the free woman.”"
    },
    {
      "v": 31,
