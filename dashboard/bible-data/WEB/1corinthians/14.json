      "t": "For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries."

      "v": 3,
      "t": "But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation."

      "t": "He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly."
    },
    {
      "v": 5,
      "t": "Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up."
    },
    {
      "v": 6,
      "t": "But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?"

      "v": 7,
      "t": "Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?"
    },
    {
      "v": 8,
      "t": "For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?"
    },
    {
      "v": 9,
      "t": "So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air."
    },

      "v": 10,
      "t": "There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning."

      "v": 11,
      "t": "If then I don’t know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me."

      "v": 12,
      "t": "So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly."
    },
    {
      "v": 13,
      "t": "Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret."
    },

      "v": 14,
      "t": "For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
    },

      "v": 15,
      "t": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."

    },
    {
      "v": 17,
      "t": "For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up."

      "t": "I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all."

      "t": "Brothers, don’t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature."

    },
    {
      "v": 22,
      "t": "Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe."

      "t": "But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all."
    },
    {
      "v": 25,
      "t": "And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed."
    },

      "v": 26,
      "t": "What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, or has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up."
    },
    {
      "v": 27,

      "t": "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,"
