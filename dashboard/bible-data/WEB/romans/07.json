    },
    {
      "v": 2,
      "t": "For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband."
    },
    {
      "v": 3,
      "t": "So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man."
    },
    {
      "v": 4,
      "t": "Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God."
    },
    {
      "v": 5,
      "t": "For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to death."
    },
    {
      "v": 6,
      "t": "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter."
    },
    {
      "v": 7,
      "t": "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”"
    },
    {
      "v": 8,
      "t": "But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead."

      "v": 9,
      "t": "I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."

      "v": 12,
      "t": "Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good."
    },
    {
      "v": 13,
      "t": "Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, was producing death in me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful."

      "v": 14,
