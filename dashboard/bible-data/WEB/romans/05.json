    {
      "v": 13,
      "t": "For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law."
    },
    {
      "v": 14,
      "t": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren’t like Adam’s disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come."

    {
      "v": 15,
      "t": "But the free gift isn’t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many."

    {
      "v": 16,

      "v": 17,
      "t": "For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ."
    },
    {
      "v": 18,
      "t": "So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life."
    },
    {
      "v": 19,
      "t": "For as through the one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous."

      "v": 20,
      "t": "The law came in that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;"
    },
    {
      "v": 21,
      "t": "that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
